Project Title: Basic Python Story Generator

1. Project Description
The Basic Python Story Generator is a beginner-friendly Python project that allows users to create random, fun, and personalized stories by inputting keywords. It's similar to the classic "Mad Libs" game, where you fill in blanks with nouns, verbs, etc., and get a unique story each time.

2. Features
- Interactive command-line interface  
- User inputs for characters, places, and actions  
- Random story selection  
- Simple string formatting and random module usage  
- Beginner-friendly structure

3. Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Standard Python libraries (random, sys)

4. Python Code
import random

# Predefined story templates with placeholders
stories = [
    "Once upon a time in {place}, there lived a {adjective} {noun}. It loved to {verb} all day long.",
    "In the land of {place}, a brave {noun} named {name} decided to {verb} the evil dragon.",
    "{name} was walking through {place} when suddenly a {adjective} {noun} appeared and tried to {verb}!"
]

def get_user_inputs():
    print("Enter the following to generate your story:")
    name = input("Name: ")
    place = input("Place: ")
    noun = input("Noun (person, thing, or animal): ")
    verb = input("Verb (action word): ")
    adjective = input("Adjective (describing word): ")
    return {
        "name": name,
        "place": place,
        "noun": noun,
        "verb": verb,
        "adjective": adjective
    }

def generate_story(inputs):
    story_template = random.choice(stories)
    story = story_template.format(**inputs)
    return story

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_inputs = get_user_inputs()
    print("\nHere is your story:\n")
    print(generate_story(user_inputs))

5. How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to input words (name, place, noun, verb, adjective).
2. It randomly selects a story template.
3. The placeholders in the story are replaced with the userâ€™s inputs using Python's str.format() method.
4. A complete and funny story is printed out.

6. Possible Enhancements
- Add more story templates for variety  
- Save stories to a .txt file  
- Build a simple GUI using Tkinter or a web app using Flask  
- Add support for multiple rounds of story generation  
- Include emojis or ASCII art for fun visuals
